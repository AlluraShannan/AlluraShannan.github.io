        <div class="Lorem-hero">As a first-year web programmer and designer, I have developed a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, allowing me to create functional and simple websites. I’m comfortable structuring web pages and styling them to create user-friendly, responsive layouts. I’ve also started learning the importance of accessibility and usability in web design, ensuring that the websites I create are easy to navigate and inclusive to everyone. While I’m still building my skills as a novice web programmer, I’m confident in my ability to grow my skills as I continue to learn, and I'm excited to develop my problem-solving abilities and dedication to the craft, as well as constantly expanding my knowledge of new web technologies.</div>
