        <div class="Lorem-hero">All my life I have been looking for where I belong in the world; some place that I could truly leave my mark on the world and feel fulfilled. It wasn't until late last year that that I found the courage to chase that feeling, the one that eventually lead me to NSCC IT Campus, following in my fathers footsteps. Going forward my mission is simple: find a way to mix my creativity with structural logic and dive into the rich world of IT, where I can put my hard work and dedication to use in the fulled extent.</div>
