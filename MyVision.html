        <div class="Lorem-hero">In May of 2026 when I graduate from the IT Web Programming course, I will hit the ground running to achieve my vision: To strengthen my web development skills in a practical environment by creating beautiful, user-friendly websites that are accessible to everyone, while learning to adapt to new technologies and improving every step of the way. In this I hope to help create connections that will shape the coming years of website design and programming.</div>
